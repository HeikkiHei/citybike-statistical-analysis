# Roadmap

The scope of this project was very limited. Some further work is listed here:

### Operator-mode

The citybike operator balance the availability of bikes by moving bikes around the city with trucks. For this purpose a different UI would be better.

### GPS-location

Center map to user gps location

### Automated suggestions

- Suggest stations with spare bikes
- Show which nearby station has most bikes

### Nearby stations

- Add information about amount of bikes in nearby stations to the model

### Events and other anomalies

Availability of citybikes is greatly effected by events, holidays, public transport interruptions etc. This could be taken into account in the predictions.
